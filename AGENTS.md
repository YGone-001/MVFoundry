# AGENTS.md — MVFoundry

## Mission

MVFoundry is a local-first, song-independent AI music video production framework. Engine source lives in this repository; every song production lives outside it in an external workspace addressed by `MV_WORKSPACE_ROOT`.

## Repository identity

- Project name: MVFoundry.
- Subtitle: AI Music Video Production Framework.
- Repository: https://github.com/YGone-001/MVFoundry
- Target branch: `main`.
- This repository contains reusable engine code only.

## Source of truth

1. Actual source and observed command output.
2. `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `factory/` and its tests.
3. `docs/project-config.md`, `docs/official-skills.md`, `docs/workspace-safety.md`, `docs/rendering.md`.
4. The external project's `project.json`, approved assets, hashes and rights records.
5. The five active Skills in `.agents/skills/`.

Do not treat plans, prior reports or user summaries as proof of the current files.

## Hard invariants

### Engine / production separation

- Never add a song, recording, lyric, reference image, production scene or rendered video to this repository.
- Never copy production media into tests, fixtures, caches or build output.
- A new production must be loadable from configuration without editing engine source.
- Synthetic fixtures must be clearly synthetic, generated, and free of third-party media.

### Workspace safety

- `MV_WORKSPACE_ROOT` is required. Missing configuration must fail closed; there is no repository fallback.
- Workspace roots inside this repository, or that contain this repository, are rejected.
- Project IDs are restricted; directory names must equal `projectId`.
- All manifest paths are canonicalized. Absolute paths, parent traversal and junction/symlink escapes are rejected.
- Staging, frames, caches, reports and renders stay inside the external project.
- No public HTTP service may expose local media.

### Timeline and rendering

- Integer output frames are the canonical editing clock; scene ranges are half-open `[startFrame, endFrame)`.
- Resolve the shot from the raw output frame before applying renderer sampling.
- Renderer sampling is local to the selected renderer. Use `floor(localFrame * samplingFps / outputFps)`; never quantize before selection.
- Soundtrack timing is authoritative and is never retimed by animation sampling.
- Do not make one song's duration, scene count, resolution, fps or pixel profile a global constant.
- Video and hybrid renderers are typed placeholders; they must fail closed.
- Local rendering uses Remotion `renderFrames` plus system FFmpeg in the current environment.

### Skills and evidence

- Active project Skills: `music-video-director`, `visual-identity-continuity`, `ai-shot-production`, `remotion-mv-compositor`, `music-video-quality-gate`.
- Official Remotion Skills are installed separately; they are not vendored here.
- Any completion claim requires observed evidence. Missing evidence is NOT RUN, never PASS.

### Publication and provider activity

- No commit or push unless the user explicitly authorizes it.
- No paid API, model call, upload, remote deployment or third-party transmission of local media.
- No secrets, credentials, tokens or private absolute paths in source, docs or fixtures.
- Use the publication allowlist and audit before staging; never `git add .` or `git add -A`.

## Commands

```bash
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run compositions
npm run seed:examples
npm run render:project -- --project synthetic-pixel-demo --mode video --frames 0-23
npm run audit:git
npm run audit:publication
```

Set `MV_WORKSPACE_ROOT` to a path outside this repository. Set `REMOTION_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE` or `CHROME_PATH` when Remotion cannot locate a browser.

## Skill routing

- Song analysis, treatment, chapters, cues, shots → `music-video-director`.
- Style profile, palette, character/environment continuity → `visual-identity-continuity`.
- AI shot contracts, keyframes, hashes, provider authorization → `ai-shot-production`.
- Frame clock, registry, renderers, local media, Remotion composition → `remotion-mv-compositor`.
- Acceptance, audits, PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED/NOT RUN → `music-video-quality-gate`.
- Remotion API or CLI questions → official `remotion-*` Skills.

## Agent startup

Agents that do not auto-discover `.agents/skills` must read this file and the five active Skill files explicitly. Native discovery is not universal across Codex, DeepSeek or other clients.

## Scope boundary

P0-G publishes the reusable engine only. It does not start a music-video production, generate media, migrate a private production, or call providers.
